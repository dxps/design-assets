Used Alt based shortcuts (to mimick the macOS layout, where Cmd (instead of Alt) is near the SPACE).

### Sidebar: Toggling or Walking through the main views

-   `Alt + b` to toggle the sidebar visibility.

-   `Alt + 1` to show the Explorer view (`View: Show Explorer` command).
-   `Alt + 2` to show the Search view (`View: Show Search` command).
-   `Alt + 3` to show the Source Control view (`Source Control: Focus on Source Control View` command).
-   `Alt + 4` to show the Run & Debug view (`View: Show Run and Debug` command).
-   `Alt + 5` to show the Extensions view (`View: Show Extensions` command).
-   `Alt + 6` to show the go Test Explorer view (`View: Show go Test Explorer` command).
-   `Alt + 7` to show the Thunder Client view (`View: Show Thunder Client` command).
-   `Alt + 0` toggles the Problems view.

### Show All Commands & Go to file

-   `Alt + SHIFT + p` for `Show All Commands`
-   `Alt + p` for `Go to File ...`

### Navigation

-   `Ctrl + Alt + RightArrow` to navigate to the right (ex: sidebar, as I have it on the right side).
-   `Ctrl + Alt + RightArrow` to move to the left.

### Editors: Navigation, Closing, Moving

-   By default, the key bindings for navigation are:
    -   `Alt + LeftArrow` for going to the previous editor.
    -   `Alt + RightArrow` for going to the next editor.
-   `Alt + w` for closing the active editor.
-   `Ctrl + Alt + SHIFT + RightArrow` for move the current editor to the next (right) group (creating a dual view, if needed).
-   `Ctrl + Alt + SHIFT + LeftArrow` for move the current editor to the previous (left) group (removing a dual view, if needed).

### Editing

-   `Alt + d` or `Alt + y` for deleting the current line.
-   `Ctrl + d` for duplicating the current line.

The other useful default remained as-is:

-   `Alt + UpArrow` for moving the current line up.
-   `Alt + DownArrow` for moving the current line down.

### Quick Doc

-   `Alt + q` for `Show Hover` that shows the documentation of the element.

### Menu Bar

-   `Alt + F10` to toggle menu bar.

### Comment

-   Using `Ctrl + /` it comments (or uncomments, if it's commented) the line and moves the cursor to the next line (same behavior that exists in IntelliJ products).
