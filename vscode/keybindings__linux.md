- `ALT + w` for closing the active editor
- `CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + RightArrow` for move the current editor to the next (right) group (creating a dual view, if needed).
- `CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + LeftArrow` for move the current editor to the previous (left) group (removing a dual view, if needed).

### Editing

- `ALT + d` or `ALT + y` for deleting the current line
- `CTRL + d` for duplicating the current line

The other useful default remained as-is:

- `ALT + UpArrow` for moving the current line up
